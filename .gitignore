# --- Data Files ---
# IGNORE the raw original data IF it's large or easily re-downloadable from source (Dryad)
data/raw/HBD_Mixed_anions.zip 
# If you unzipped it MANUALLY into data/raw/HBD_Mixed_anions/, then add:
data/raw/HBD_Mixed_anions/ 

# IGNORE intermediate, unzipped data - this is generated by scripts
data/interim/unzipped_HBD_Mixed_anions/

# IGNORE intermediate parsed collections of CSVs - these are used to build the DB
data/interim/parsed_property_collections/*.csv

# DO NOT IGNORE your final processed CSV IF your scripts expect it to exist (but DB is better)
# If your 03_build_database.py READS from data/processed/material_summary_properties.csv,
# then DO NOT ignore data/processed/material_summary_properties.csv specifically if it's small
# However, the DB is the primary target, so summary CSV might become redundant.
# For now, let's assume the DB is the main source for the app.
data/processed/material_summary_properties.csv # IF you decide to commit this processed summary

# --- SQLite Database ---
# IMPORTANT: For a portfolio project deployable on Streamlit Cloud,
# you usually WANT to commit your FINAL SQLite database file if it's not too large.
# UNCOMMENT THE LINE BELOW IF YOU WANT TO IGNORE IT and have users generate it.
# data/processed/perovskite_platform.sqlite
# *.sqlite # More general ignore for all sqlite files - be careful

# --- Machine Learning Models ---
# IMPORTANT: Similar to the database, for easy deployment of your dashboard with predictions,
# you usually WANT to commit your trained .pkl/.joblib model files if not too large.
# UNCOMMENT THE LINES BELOW IF YOU WANT TO IGNORE THEM and have users re-train.
# models/*.pkl
# models/*.joblib
# Or if they are directly in src/surrogate_models_trained/
# src/surrogate_models_trained/*.pkl
# src/surrogate_models_trained/*.joblib

# Notebooks: usually good to commit your analysis notebooks
# but ignore their checkpoints
notebooks/.ipynb_checkpoints/ # Example if you moved it from root
test_parsing.ipynb # Keep this if it's useful in the root
# notebooks/01_EDA_and_Trend_Analysis.ipynb # Example name if in notebooks folder
# notebooks/02_Surrogate_Modeling.ipynb  # Example name if in notebooks folder
